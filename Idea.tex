\title{Yume Nikki: Idea}
\date{23rd February, 2020}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
The idea to my video is the representation or an tribute for a one of my favourite video games: "Yume Nikki", what does it mean Dream journal.

The idea or what I like to transmit to the viewer is that feeling that i had when I played the game at the fist time. A mixture of sadness and confusion, but at the same time, beauty and calm, melancholic and 
tranquillity.

So, my video will be conformed by some scenes from the game and some locations which I consider are very important or iconic to the game and the community.

One thing that I like to mention is that I want to try "copy" the concepts from another 2D animation from the same game. I would like to use the ideas from that video and recreate, using 3D tools.
