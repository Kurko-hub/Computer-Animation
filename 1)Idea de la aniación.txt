The idea to my video is make a videomusic who was a representation or an tribute for a one of my favourite video games:
"Yume Nikki", what does it mean Dream journal.
The idea or what I like to transmit to the viewer is that feeling that i had when I played the
game at the first time. A mixture of sadness and confusion, but at the same time, beauty and calm,
melancholic and tranquillity.
So, my video will be conformed by some scenes from the game and some locations which I
consider are very important or iconic to the game and the community.
One thing that I like to mention is that I want to try recreate the video from another 2D
animation from the same game. I will use the ideas from that video and recreate, using
3D tools in this case, Blender.
